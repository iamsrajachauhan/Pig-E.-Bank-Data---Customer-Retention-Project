# Pig-E.-Bank-Data---Customer-Retention-Project
This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the steps involved in initial data exploration and decision tree modelling, completed as part of a beginner's data mining project. The project served as an educational exercise, utilizing data mining techniques on a dataset of bank clients to identify the risk factors that have contributed to customers leaving the bank.

# Project Overview
This analysis was designed to explore data mining, with a particular emphasis on understanding how decision trees are constructed and applied to predict whether bank clients are likely to leave based on their profiles. This exercise is a component of a broader curriculum intended to build proficiency in navigating ethical challenges in data analytics and to sharpen predictive analysis skills.

# Repository Structure
Jupyter Notebook: The main file [5.4Data_Mining.ipynb](https://github.com/iamsrajachauhan/Pig-E.-Bank-Data---Customer-Retention-Project/blob/main/5.4Data%20mining.ipynb) includes comprehensive steps from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, to modeling and predictions using a decision tree classifier.

# Key Objectives
Understand and execute data cleaning and preprocessing.
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns.
Develop a decision tree model to predict customer churn.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and interpret the results.

# Tools Used
Python: Utilized for all data manipulation and analysis tasks.
Pandas & NumPy: Employed for handling data structures and performing numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for creating visualizations.
Scikit-learn: Applied for building and evaluating the decision tree model.

# Decision Tree Insights
The decision tree created in this project helps in identifying the key factors influencing client decisions to leave the bank, providing insights that can potentially guide retention strategies.

# Visualizations
This project includes various charts and a detailed decision tree visualization which illustrate the relationships between client attributes and their churn status.

# Conclusion and Recommendations
The findings and methodology from this exercise provide a foundational understanding of how decision tree models can be developed and tuned in a data mining context, offering a structured approach to predictive analytics.
